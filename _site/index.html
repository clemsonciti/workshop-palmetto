  <h2 id="policy">Policy</h2>

  <h3 id="university-sanctioned-events-policy">University Sanctioned Events Policy:</h3>
  <p>Students participating in participating in University sanctioned events such
as, but not limited to, the Marching Band, musical ensembles, theatre group,
athletic events, forensics competition, etc., will be granted an excused
absence for class periods missed. Students will be granted the privilege of
taking, at an alternative time to be determined by the professor, scheduled
examinations or quizzes that will be missed. I will designate such times prior
to the event and reserve the right to provide a fair alternative to taking the
examination or quiz that will be missed. Students must submit original
documentation on University letterhead signed by the activity director, coach,
or adviser detailing the specifics of the event in advance. Specific
requirements include:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Responsibility for meeting academic requirements rests with the student.</li>
    <li>Students are expected to notify their professors as soon as they know they
will be missing class due to a University sanctioned event.</li>
    <li>Students are expected to complete the work requirement for each class and
turn in assignments due on days of the event prior to their due dates unless
other arrangements are made with myself.</li>
    <li>If a scheduled event is postponed or canceled, the student is expected to
go to class.</li>
    <li>Students are not excused from classes for practice on nonevent days.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The following are specifics for the student athlete:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The student athlete is expected, where possible, to schedule classes on
days and at hours that do not conflict with athletic schedules.</li>
    <li>Athletes are not excused from classes for practice or training-room
treatment on nongame days.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="email-policy">Email Policy:</h3>
  <p>It is expected that faculty, staff, and students activate and maintain regular
access to University provided e-mail accounts. Official university
communications, including those from your instructor, will be sent through your
university e-mail account. You are responsible for accessing that mail to be
sure to obtain official University communications. Failure to access will not
exempt individuals from the responsibilities associated with this course.</p>

  <p>Please abide by the following email etiquette policies to ensure clear
communication:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Subject Line</strong>:	Please include a descriptive and specific subject heading for
all of your emails, including course and section number (e.g. “CSC 050-23:
Question about lab 1”).</li>
    <li><strong>Greeting</strong>:	Please make a clear and appropriate greeting; I will not answer
emails addressed to “hey” or “yo”. Please address me as Dr. Ngo, or “Professor”.</li>
    <li><strong>Tone &amp; Style</strong>:	Always use a tone and language that is appropriate to an
academic setting; I will not respond to emails that are written in short-hand
or without proper punctuation and grammar. Your emails should not resemble a
text message.</li>
    <li><strong>Sign and Proofread</strong>:	Always sign your full name, especially if you are
writing from your smart phone. Always proofread your emails before sending.</li>
    <li><strong>Email Account</strong>:	I do not care which email account you send email from, as
long as it is clearly addressed and signed so that I know who you are. But
please be advised to appropriately link the email that you wish to use with
myWCU and D2L; I will be using those services to send out emails to the
entire class. It is your responsibility to make sure this is configured
correctly so that you receive my emails.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="computer-science-department-dishonesty-policy">Computer Science Department Dishonesty Policy:</h3>
  <p>The Computer Science Committee has adopted the following policies in regard
to academic dishonesty in Computer Science classes:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>A student found to be academically dishonest in an assignment will receive
zero for that assignment if it is his/her first offense in that class [the
course, not the class period], but an F for the course if it is for his/her
second offense in that class [the course].</li>
    <li>A student found to be academically dishonest in a test will receive the
grade of F in that class [the course].</li>
    <li>For the purposes of this document on academic dishonesty, every form or
method of evaluation in a class will be considered as being of one of two
types: an assignment or a test. Assignments include homework assignments, and
short quizzes [and labs]. Tests include final exams and major exams. An
instructor has, subject to these guidelines, the discretion to determine the
type of any other form of evaluation, such as a project, in his/her class.</li>
    <li>A student who has received the grade of F in a course because of academic
dishonesty and who wants or is required to repeat that course may re-take
that course only as a regularly scheduled course that is open to the student
community in general. In exceptional circumstances, this condition may be
revoked, but only by an explicit action to that effect by the full Computer
Science Committee, and only then on a case by case basis.</li>
    <li>The term academic dishonesty is used throughout in the sense provided by
the rules and regulations of West Chester University. The following is taken
from The Ram’s Eye View of 1997-1998: <strong>“Academic dishonesty as it applies to
students includes but is not limited to academic cheating; plagiarism; the
sale, purchase, or exchange of term papers or research papers; falsification
of information which includes any form of providing false or misleading
information, written, electronic, or oral; or of altering or falsifying
official institutional records. Plagiarism is defined as copying another’s
work or portion thereof and/or using ideas and concepts of another and
presenting them as one’s own without giving proper credit to the source.”</strong></li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="no-grade-violation-of-academic-integrity-and-violation-of-student-code-of-conduct-policy">No-Grade, Violation of Academic Integrity, and Violation of Student Code of Conduct Policy:</h3>
  <p>For questions regarding Academic Dishonesty, the No-Grade policy, Sexual
Harassment, or the Student Code of Conduct, students are encouraged to refer
to their major department’s handbook, the Undergraduate Course Catalogue, the
Rams Eye View, or the University Web Site. Please understand that improper
conduct in any of these areas will not be tolerated and may result in
immediate ejections from the class.</p>

  <h3 id="ada-policy">ADA Policy:</h3>
  <p>If you have a disability that requires accommodations under the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA), please present your letter of accommodations
and meet with me as soon as possible so that I can support your success in
an informed manner. Accommodations cannot be granted retroactively. If you
would like to know more about West Chester University’s Services for Students
with Disabilities (OSSD), please contact the OSSD which is located at 223
Lawrence Center. The OSSD hours of Operation are
Monday – Friday 8:30 a.m. – 4:30 p.m. Their phone number is 610-436-2564,

the <a href="http://www.wcupa.edu/ussss/ossd">OSSD website</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="title-ix-statement">Title IX Statement:</h3>
  <p>West Chester University and its faculty are committed to assuring a safe and
productive educational environment for all students. In order to meet this
commitment and to comply with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972
and guidance from the Office for Civil Rights, the University requires
faculty members to report incidents of sexual violence shared by students
to the University’s Title IX Coordinator, Ms. Lynn Klingensmith. The only
exceptions to the faculty member’s reporting obligation are when incidents
of sexual violence are communicated by a student during a classroom
discussion, in a writing assignment for a class, or as part of a
University-approved research project. Faculty members are obligated to
report sexual violence or any other abuse of a student who was, or is, a
child (a person under 18 years of age) when the abuse allegedly occurred to
the person designated in the University protection of minors policy.<br />
Information regarding the reporting of sexual violence and the resources
that are available to victims of sexual violence is set forth at the
<a href="http://www.wcupa.edu/_admin/social.equity">Office of Social Equity website</a>.</p>
