## Windows machines

### using MobaXTerm

For small file transfers, the Windows users can use the built-in function in MobaXTerm. On the left side of the MobaXTerm window, you will see the browser of your Palmetto directory. By default, it points to your home directory: `/home/<your Palmetto username>`. You can point it to any other folder that you have access to, for example, to `/scratch1/<your Palmetto username>`. To upload files *to* Palmetto, use the UP arrow, and to download files *from* Palmetto, use the DOWN arrow.
