- "What is Palmetto?"

---
Palmetto is a *supercomputing cluster*: a set of powerful computers that are connected to each other. It is built and maintained by Clemson University, and is located off campus, close to Anderson SC, in a dedicated building which is powered by a dedicated power plant.

Currently, the Palmetto cluster is ranked at #392 in the list of the world's most powerful computers (#9 among the United States' universities). 

The Almetto cluster is maintained by two teams: a team of system administrators, who works directly at the cluster, and monitors its hardware and operating system, and a team of *research facilitators*, who work with the Palmetto users. The two teams work very closely together.

We maintain a [very extensive website]("https://www.palmetto.clemson.edu/palmetto/") which hosts plenty of information for Palmetto users.
